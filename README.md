# BCI application

At the beginning of development, the repository contains skeleton code for the application. 

* Core: `bci-core` contains the domain classes
* Interaction: `bci-app` contains the user interaction classes
* UML diagrams: `uml` will contain the diagrams from the first delivery

The names of the classes already present must not be changed.
Some classes must not be changed in any way, no matter the reason.
See details on the course pages.

Note that not all the code has to be working for all deliveries (penalties may apply).
Check the assessment conditions on the course pages.
